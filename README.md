    # **Tiny_World**
Simulation Builder Application.

	**About the application**

	**What is Tiny_World**
An application for creating and developing various simulations, containing tools for convenient work. Procedural generation, cellular automata, 2D, 3D noise or other models, whatever you want to implement. The application only provides tools for convenient work.

	**About the application**
The application will be a canvas with a convenient visual interface on the sides. The application itself does nothing! If you need to generate something, then use the built-in interpreter. It will allow you to immediately test your simulation code and output the result to the canvas. Tiny World is a space that saves your time. Just as most people in game dev do not create new game engines, there is no longer a need to create applications for running any models or simulations. Use Tiny World:3

	**Also more abilities**
It is also planned to add a browser where the most popular and widespread models for work would be stored, so that you do not waste time and can save your own or borrow someone elseâ€™s work.

	**Are you an artist at heart?**
Then why don't you create a simulation to generate...hmm...trees for example! Imagine any shapes, any colors, space trees. All you need is... oh... an understanding of how to program it and how to install it. Buuuuut, we have a browser) If you are a cute little potato, just borrow and experiment with someone else's simulation)
